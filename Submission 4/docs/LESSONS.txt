1 a) Positives of the group:
 	-Willingness to work together anytime of the day.
	-Willingness to contribute to tasks which aren’t included in their role in the team.


1 b) Negatives of the group:
	-There was only one experienced coder; others were doing it for the first time.
	-Not all people in the group were in the same branch, so the work collided with other projects.
	-No one knew much about making the GUI of the Java application.

1 c) What would you do differently next time?
	-Start working on the GUI part of the application from the beginning.
	-Start code development on an earlier stage.
	-Assign more specific tasks to people.
